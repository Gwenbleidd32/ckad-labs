### CKAD Challenge Question

The board of team Neptune decided to take over control of one e-commerce webserver from the default namespace.

The admin who once setup this webserver is not part of the organization any longer. All the information you could get was that the application contains a system called `parser`. 

Search for the application containing the parser system and migrate it into the `neptune` namespace.

Git clone this repository to setup this lab and follow the below steps:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Gwenbleidd32/ckad-labs.git

cd ckad-labs

chmod +x migrate.sh

./migrate.sh
```

These steps will setup the environment required for this question:.

The answer to this question will be posted at a later date!
